# Glossary

2.5D
: Most GIS do not actually achieve full 3 dimensional representations of landscapes, but instead render representations in 2.5 dimensions. This means that an attribute value is used instead of a full spatial location in the z axis. DTMs are an example of 2.5 dimensional representations.

RMS
: Root Mean Square. This is an error measurement that most GIS report during geometric transformation of data sets. It is mathematically the spatial equivalent to the standard deviation. The RMS error is often used as a measure of the accuracy of tic points when registering a map to a digitiser, indicating the discrepancy between known point locations and their digitised locations. The lower the RMS error, the more accurate the digitising or transformation [@walker1993agi]. The fact that the RMS error is expressed as one simple figure (e.g. 5.67 m) unfortunately does not mean that any point in the transformed image will be within this distance from its 'real' coordinates. In fact, the actual error can vary across the image depending on the number, placement, and accuracy of the tiepoints used.

TIN
: Triangulated Irregular Network. A form of the tesseral model based on triangles. The vertices of the triangles form irregularly spaced nodes and unlike the DEM, the TIN allows dense information in complex areas, and sparse information in simpler or more homogeneous areas. The TIN data set includes topological relationships between points and their neighbouring triangles. Each sample point has an X,Y co-ordinate and a surface, or Z-Value. These points are connected by edges to form a set of non-overlapping triangles used to represent the surface. Tins are also called irregular triangular mesh or irregular triangular surface model [@walker1993agi].
